## What’s New
Simplified JWT Configuration for Enhanced Security and User Experience
We're excited to announce a significant update to the Conjur Credentials plugin for Jenkins, focusing on simplifying and enhancing the JWT (JSON Web Token) configuration process. Our goal with this update is to streamline the user experience while increasing the security of your configurations.

## Key Updates:
- **Reduced Complexity:** We've reduced the number of custom fields in the JWT configuration. This approach not only simplifies the configuration process but also enhances the overall security by minimizing potential vulnerabilities.
- **Deprecation of Some Fields:** Please note that some fields (claims) have been deprecated in this update. Fields are restricted to pre-selected values, please ensure your existing configuration is compatible. This means that certain custom user inputs will no longer be supported. This change is critical for maintaining a secure and efficient configuration environment.
- **Simplified Configuration:he number of custom fields in the JWT configuration. This approach not only simplifies the configuration process but also enhances the overall security by minimizing potential vulnerabilities.
- **Deprecation of Some Fields:** Please note th** This functionality allows you to temporarily use some "grandfathered" values from your previous configurations. This interim solution is available until the next release, providing a comfortable adjustment period.

## Impact on Your Environment:
These changes are designed to enhance both security and user experience. However, they may impact your current environment due to the deprecation of certain fields and the shift towards a more streamlined configuration approach. We encourage you to review your current configurations and adapt to the new system, leveraging simplified configuration for an easier transition.

We strongly recommend utilizing the default values recommended for fields that will be deprecated. These defaults are either system-generated or selected from an approved list of values, ensuring optimal security and compatibility.
